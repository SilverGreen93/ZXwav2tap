# ZXwav2tap

This program lets you convert tape recordings from WAV format to TAP format. The TAP files can then be loaded in any emulator like Spectaculator or Warajevo.

The sources are built using Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0

This is a translated version of the original Russian wave to tape converter for ZX Spectrum by Dmitry Trunov from 2009, http://www.animekazan.net/forum2
